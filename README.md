# SelectiveKernel-Replication
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of Selective Kernel (SK) convolutions, enabling adaptive receptive field sizes via a Split-Fuse-Select attention mechanism. It allows stacking SK units to build SKNet architectures for flexible multi-scale feature learning.
